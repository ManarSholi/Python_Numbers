## NumPy
    Uses python by bringing super fast multi dimentional arrays that take less memory that built in lists in python.
    So any time you want to work with large, multi dimentional arrays, NumPy is the best choice.
    - To Return tuple of the number of rows and columns
       two_dimentional_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
       two_dimentional_array.shape
    - To get the Element in first row and first column
       random_init_array = np.random.random((3, 4))
       random_init_array[0, 0]
    - To Return the numbers that are greater than 0.2
       random_init_array[random_init_array > 0.2]
